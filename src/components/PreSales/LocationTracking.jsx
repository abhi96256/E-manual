        <ul>
          <li>An employee begins an activity (e.g., a meeting) using the mobile application.</li>
          <li>The system captures the start time, location, and relevant information (e.g., captured location or client details).</li>
          <li>Managers can export the activity logs for analysis, which can be used for performance reviews, time management assessments, and operational insights.</li>
        </ul>

        /><br />

        <p>
          The system captures the distance travelled for each activity, displayed in the "Distance (Km)" column. At the end of the day, the total distance travelled by the employee can be viewed in the summary report, providing an overview of their movement throughout the day.
