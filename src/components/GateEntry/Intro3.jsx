            Visitor Pass system implemented in the Inventory Movement and
            Management (IMM) module at 3S Logics Pvt. Ltd. Its primary objective
            is to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in handling
            inventory, material dispatches, stock transfers, visitor or vehicle
            monitoring, and overall inventory control processes within
            organizational premises.

          <p>
            By leveraging this integrated solution, organizations can automate
            visitor and vehicle registration, monitor inventory flows, and
            maintain robust records for both operational and compliance
            purposes. This ensures that all processes, ranging from gate
            entries to inventory transactions, are accurately recorded and
            efficiently managed.
