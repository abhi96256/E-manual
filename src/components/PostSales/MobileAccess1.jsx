          Users can effortlessly add new items to their ticket by selecting from an extensive and organized list of available options. As they input the quantity for each item, the system dynamically calculates the total price in real-time, taking into account the chosen billing structure—whether it's a flat rate, hourly, or tiered pricing model. This ensures that the pricing remains accurate and transparent throughout the process. The updated total is immediately reflected in the ticket summary, offering users a clear, up-to-date view of their costs at all times.

          Users also have full flexibility to modify their selections by easily editing quantities, adjusting items, or removing them altogether. This level of control empowers users to fine-tune their billing as needed, streamlining the entire process and providing greater confidence in managing their charges.

This seamless and responsive process not only enhances the overall user experience by making it intuitive and straightforward but also empowers users to monitor their expenditures with ease, ensuring they are always aware of the financial implications of their choices.

        <p>
          If the engineer has successfully arrived at the client’s location, they can select the "Reached" status. This selection is crucial as it not only updates the ticket but also provides visibility to both the team and the client regarding the engineer’s on-site presence. Upon selecting this status, the engineer will be prompted to specify the exact date and time of their arrival. This timestamp is automatically recorded, ensuring an accurate log of the service timeline, which can be valuable for future reference and reporting.
