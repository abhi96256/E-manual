        Service Request Management simplifies handling service requests from
        submission to resolution. Users enter contact information, either by
        adding new contacts or importing existing ones, and then proceed to the
        Service Request Form. This leads to two workflows: one for creating a
        service ticket with details like category, issue, priority, and assigned
        engineer, and another for viewing and managing all requests, including
        options to update, duplicate, respond to, cancel, or close tickets.
        <br />
        <br />
        The system displays requests in a list with filtering options for criteria
        like status and priority. Each entry shows key details, such as request
        ID, issue category, and status. Action buttons allow users to update, add
        notes, reassign engineers, or close tickets, and bulk actions can be
        performed for multiple requests. Success depends on accurate, consistent
        data and a user-friendly interface. The system can also support payment
        collection by tracking payment statuses, generating invoices, and managing
        outstanding payments, offering a complete solution for service management
        and billing.
